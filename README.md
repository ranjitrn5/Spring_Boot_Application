# Spring_Boot_Application

This is a Single Page Demo Application on World War II wrecked warships. This application shows a list of world war ships that were wrecked during war.

I have built this application using AngularJS at the front end and Spring Boot framework at the back end. This is a learning project that helped me to learn about the core concepts of Spring Boot.

In order to test the accuracy of the codes created I have developed sample test cases using JUnit, Mockito and Hamcrest Testing Framework.
